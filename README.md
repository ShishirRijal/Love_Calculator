# love_calculator
This is a love calculating app with a really simple and elegant UI built in flutter.
It enables a user to calculate the love percentage between user himself/herself and the partner.. 
This app is my effort to digitalize the love calculating technique we used to use in our school life.
It uses the same algorithm as we used to use in school life, thus the calculation is precise and consistent.

# note
Though the love percentage calculated by the app concides with the love percentage calulated by traditional technique, the percentage is not a real love match between you and your partner.. So take it with a pinch of salt... Enjoy :)

The UI of this love calculator app is inspired from the UI provided in dribble by Dixita Ganatra.
